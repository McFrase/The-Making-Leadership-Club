                    <p>If I asked you, WHO ARE YOU? What will be your answer?</p>
                    <p>How many of you can introduce yourself to a stranger in 15 seconds
                        But repeating the same aura of confidence in a stranger, spontaneous atmosphere is the key.
                         Let’s talk about Baby Steps, I know you have big dreams and you can do many things
                        with many aspirations and sometimes you get overwhelmed but...</p>
                    <p>BABY STEPS over GIANT STEPS
                        Leave the glory days alone and focus on the NOW
                        What does your hand find doing now and what gives you the greatest fulfillment?
                        The quest for money is the reason why many burn out on this road to maximizing potentials
                        Money is good but you should ask yourself, hope you are not losing your humanity in the process
                    </p>
                    <p>How often do you take breaks?
                        How often do you reflect?
                        Are you competing with those you should be learning from?
                        Are you feeling intimidated by them when you should feel inspired?
                        How secure are you in your thoughts?

                    <p>How confident are you in your space?
                        What’s scaring you?
                        If you were not afraid, what would you have done differently?
                        : Let’s pause 
                        Trust me, you might not get all the answers now but they are key
                    </p>
                    <p>I posted a video on my IG page tonight and the messages I have gotten so far almost made me
                        cry
                        This is me thinking my posts didn’t really make sense…forget all that packaging 
                        I had doubts 
                        Will people listen? 
                        Will people like it? 
                        What if people find out I am a fraud? 
                        And I am not as good as I say I am? 
                        So, in the end…

                        BABY STEPS 
                        leave the glory days alone, focus on the now 
                        This will lead me to the topic of VALIDATION 
                    </p>
                    <p>A lot of us are driven by validation 
                        We tend to do it for the likes, the views, the follows, the referrals and many other reasons you
                        know 
                        But in the words of a friend, if you are doing what you are doing because you want validation, I
                        don’t believe you will be good at it
                        Validation blurs your vision and deletes the passion behind your foundation 
                        But!
                    </p>
                    <p>WHAT IF WE LEARNED TO DO THE THINGS WE DO FROM VALIDATION AND NOT FOR VALIDATION? 
                        Imagine the amazing things we could come up with

                        I will rather attempt to do something great and fail, than attempt to do nothing and succeed

                        I heard this from somewhere: The world needs what only you can provide
                        How loud is the mic? You, your story, your craft, your content is worthy

                        </p>
                    <p>Design a simple life for myself, to get rid of the excesses and focus on the essentials. You sure bet, it has not been easy? But are you doing the same? If you have not started 
                        Will you? 
                        PAUSE‼️ 
                        REFLECT ‼️ 
                        </p>
                    <p>You know why you keep doubting yourself?
                        You are taking too much info in, that you think, people have said it all and the world don’t need to hear from you
                        </p>
                    <p>DAMN THAT LIE!

                    <p>What’s stopping you from starting?

                        I know you want to change the world
                        But take it one person at a time

                        YOU ARE FIRE, YOU ARE NOT TRASH
                        I’ll need to go over again.
                        Question: Can compliment be mistaken for validation
                        Or how can one distinguish validation from compliment?
                        Answer: There’s just a thin line but they are different e
                        People do mistake compliment for validation
                        Validation is more logical than complement
                        Complement follows validation
                        </p>
                    <p>🙇🏿‍♂‍🙇🏿‍♂‍I am honoured sir.
                        I strongly believe, validation is needed, and the truth is in the deepest part of us ALL we yearn for it…
                        However, the balance I think is that it should first come from within. Like, I’m confident in myself first before the external comes…
                        I wish I could do a voice note to explain my view on this but I think this will suffice.
