                    <p>Here’s the thing, there’s always a bit of nonchalance when it comes to sharing my thoughts, because I believe that there are some words that need practical results to make them audacious. Eg if someone like Dangote says “diligence and hard work pays” it will be regarded, because he has results to show. Grab?</p>
                    <p>However, I’ve told myself that as much as that is true, there are some principles that are basic to life and success. As I discover them and put them to work, I won’t cease to share, so that we can all get ‘there’…</p>
                    <p>I shouldn’t wait till I’m the richest man in the world before I be a blessing. In fact, they even place necessity on me to be successful. This is not my emphasis, however, but I do hope this helps a writer or someone like me out there.</p>
                    <p>Now, back to the main course…</p>
                    <p>Assuming, I have bagged my first $100,000,000...“This talk for sweet well well”. However, wisdom must be shared.</p>
                    <p>Let’s fast forward a bit...</p>
                    <p>When in problem or challenges, we think and search everywhere to know the source or cause in order to fix the problem except a place, which most of the time is the source.</p>
                    <p>We can be quick to identify 5 to 10 causes which are not. Even, identify a lot of people that are the causes, but if we think deep, the real source is...</p>

                    <h6>Are you ready to see this?</h6>
                    <p>It’s YOU!</p>
                    <p>We look for all ways to blame everyone for our problems except us! Here’s the deal; until we see and own up to what we have caused and be accountable to it all… hmm, solution is still far!</p>
                    <p>I once had an experience, though the details are definitely for later for obvious reasons but let me get to the edge of it.</p>
                    <p>At some point in my life, I almost ran mad. I was so depressed. I was literally chained to the specialist hospital I was taken to. I was injected to sleep at intervals. Suicidal thoughts were my daily bread...</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons for this was that I was angry with almost everyone; especially my relatives. I might have had some sensible reasons, but I was still wrong. It was as though my relatives, both nuclear and extended were the cause of my problems. All I felt was that they owe me something... What? I don’t even know… Thank God for my mentor… I won’t forget what he told me when I was recuperating: “nobody owes you anything!”</p>

                    <p>Immediately, I had my factory settings reset.
                        Look, accepting that you are the source of your own problem opens you up to solutions.
                        If we don’t get to the root of an issue, the problem will persist. Cutting down the bad fruits or branches won’t solve the problem of the tree until we get to its root.
                        </p>
                    <p>DON’T FIGHT EFFECT, BUT RATHER THE CAUSE; FOR THIS WILL TAKE CARE OF THE RESULTANT EFFECT.</p>
                    <p>Set aside that entitlement mentality!
                        Believing that someone owes you something hinders growth and success. In fact, it shuts down one’s creativity in problem solving.
                        </p>
                    <p>Sometimes ago, my elder sister said she was going to send me money, out of her volition.
                        Based on her antecedent, I already had projections of the amount range she was going to send and I had already planned how the money should be spent
                        </p>
                    <p>Fortunately or unfortunately, she sent lower than my expectation. Now, here is the thing, I’d be ungrateful to be furious with her, because I have no idea what pressing needs she has to resolve, besides, it’s her money not mine. The fact that she cared enough to share the little she has is worth an appreciation.</p>
                    <p>P.S. Having a high expectation on what is not within your control, is mostly disappointing… Abstain from it in other to live long.</p>
                    <p>Those of us who help people sometimes fall victim to this “entitlement mentality” which purges us of all sense of responsibleness.</p>

                    <p>We feel because we helped someone in time of need, it’s their responsibility to automatically do same to us.</p>
                    <p>P.S. I’m not saying we should become ingrates and not help those that help us when we have the ability and capacity to do so. I’m only saying that even at that, those persons you help owe you nothing!</p>
                    <p>To burst your bubble, your parents don’t owe you as well. Please, I am not saying this so parents can be irresponsible or shy away from their parental duties. . . What I mean is that one shouldn’t say it is because their parents didn’t do this and that, that’s why they’re a failure.</p>
                    <p>The reason we need to pay attention to this is that as long as we see others as the source of our problems we will always think the solution is with them, thereby, shutting down the creative problem-solving part of us.</p>
                    <p>Acceptance of this truth; that you are responsible for your situation, makes you see that the solution is with you. Accepting that nobody owes you, opens you up to solutions.</p>
