                    <p>Good evening great people.
                        I believe we are fine, up and doing.
                        A great thank you to everyone teasing me ahead of my birthday.
                        I look forward to the palm wine. Do well to add roasted meat. 😎🤣

                    <p>Hope we had an amazing day.
                        The time we have waited for is here.
                        We are treating Crises and Perception.
                        I know there will definitely be different views to this. So I look forward to everyone’s submission on this topic.
                        First and foremost, I will us to deal with the term “Comfort Zone”.
                        </p>
                    <p>Life responds to men and women of greater sacrifice.
                        And it is best that one doesn’t reject an idea because it shatters one’s comfort zone. Comfort zone is a static atmosphere.
                        World wars aren’t comfort zone. The attack on Hiroshima was not comfort zone. Daniel in the den with lions that had been starved for 3 days wasn’t comfort zone. David against Goliath did not match up with comfort zone. Jesus on calvary was far away from comfort zone. Abraham sacrificing Isaac was not comfort zone.
                        This present global challenge is not comfort zone!
                        </p>
                    <p>Good evening once again, my name is Bolu Opaniran.
                        This evening, we will be journeying through this discourse together.
                        </p>
                    <p>Comfort zone is a limitation on potentials. And it kills before death.
                        It is “double-death” to have potentials that can get you food and you are dying of hunger because your knowledge vault has not captured that possibility.
                        It is “die before die.”
                        Progress demands change. People won’t progress as long as there is no change.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two types of change:
                            (I) Changes in Situations (ii) Changes in Individuals
                            The change that happens inside you is what defines the influence of what happens around you.
                            Forget Covid-19, there are businesses still thriving.
                            What changes in you defines what changes outside you.
                            Most times, what happens outside is always negative. Always generate a positive vibe that swallows up the negativity always flying around.
                            Situations will not be absolutely perfect. You see, when you think you have exhausted yourself, you have only used 40℅ of your ability and that is the comfort zone putting a stop. There is still 60% of capacity not yet tapped into.

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>As humans, not excluding anyone, we find comfort very appealing but is that all there is?
                        In the midst of this pandemic, many people have written off their expectations for the year. Many even address God to remove 2020 from their age that they did not use it.
                        Really? Quite funny though and it could be something to joke about.
                        This thing some are not taking it as a joke anymore, many have taken it as a reality because of the discomfort this time brings. And that is why our perception should be healthy.
                        </p>
                    <p>Nothing is a waste on earth. God did not create anything to be a waste. The bone from your meat that you throw on the road, a dog sees and eat, the crumbles that fall, and ant sees an eat. If you think the end is here, make do of the end and recreate it to be on motion.</p>
                    <p>We all have come out of serious situations we never thought we could come out of. Then, my question is how did we come this far? <br>
                        Many will think this is the worst thing that has happen to them, but check into your personal life, you have tasted grievous life challenges that you came out of.
                        So why is crisis helpful?
                        </p>
                    <p>Let’s take for an instance, it was during the world wars that technology took a new toll. That was when the medical field experienced different amazing possibilities that many thought were not possible. If it were to be normal life, there were different surgeries and discoveries many doctors will not attempt because it has not been validated. Here in the face of war, you either win or lose. Doctor had to ” try” a lot of things that in today world many people from all the nations of the earth now enjoy. <br>
                        During the wars, food chain was upgraded. To preserve food during wars was difficult and soldiers were dying of hunger than bullets, that was the beginning of canned foods. Transportation system changed. Many things changed that I won’t want to bore us with.

                    <p>Many say creativity is intelligence having fun and I laugh. My definition of creativity is; intelligence at work.
                        I know many people will hold contrary views but this is a conversation for another time.
                        Crises allow you to press yourself for more. You bring out potentials you never thought were there. It creates a reset in your life that will change you forever if you choose to win.
                        If you give up on 2020, your next 10 years might not be effective. There are times and seasons for everything on the earth.
                        What ideology are you breeding this moment? What possibilities are you framing in your mind?
                        </p>
                    <p>Life will not remain the same after this moment. Corona Virus or whatever you are facing will not remain forever. At a point in my life I had Tuberculosis and I thought that was the end of the world, I didn’t die.
                        That is just one out of millions of things that would have taken me out of this world, what remains is our stand in the face of challenges.
                        You either win or lose. It is a moment you either fight or fly. If you win, your life doesn’t remain the same. The war happening now is the combat hinged on knowledge. The period where we roam about we foot soldiers and life-terminating machines have passed or is rapidly passing.
                        </p>
                    <p>There was a set of soldiers when they came ashore to fight a war, they burnt their boats just to signify there is no turning back. They either win the war or die there.
                        Life demands such audacity most times. That is where the beauty of your untapped potentials come to play.
                        We never have an idea of who we are until we receive some hard knocks of life. Life is not an adventure that only pats us on our backs. Most times, it is an eye-opener accompanied with the sacrifices that change and growth demand.
                        </p>
                    <p>Sincerely, I am conscious of growth and development with less or no thought of what is happening. The bigger picture should always be before us. That is how we can get ahead.
                        You know many times they have told us the world will end. If the world would end, let it meet us advancing. Don’t “end” before the end. What books are you reading? What courses are you taking? What networks are you building? What are you doing to help your spiritual life this season? What challenges are you daring this moment?
                        Don’t wake up at the end of the day, realise what you feared did not kill you but made you waste a decisive season in your life.
                        😳😳😳😳 Think about it. 🤔🤔🤔🤔

                    <p>We were waiting for a lot of years for most things to change, but here are the realities we are in:
                        <ol class="px-4">
                            <li>Money will have a minimal impact on businesses. Businesses will be built on human capital and not financial capital. That means less money to run a business than before.</li>
                            <li>The idea of work we used to know has changed.</li>
                            <li>The idea of education we are familiar with is rapidly changing.</li>
                            <li>Indices of wealth will not be the possession of fleet of cars, houses everywhere and many other things.</li>
                            <li>There is a global competition in most businesses because location is no more a barrier.</li>
                            <li>Many things will be automated. Physical “gra gra” will be limited.😃😉 Get it going sir.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>🙏This is where I draw the curtain.
                        If any of what has being said rings a bell, kindly repost.
                        I will like to learn too. I look forward to your comments, views, opinions on this topic.
                        This is what it is!
                        </p>
                    <p>Question: Looking at way things are going, it’s obvious that things won’t come back to normal or remain the same, so, as a leader how can one be a change even in the midst of rigidity, that is, even when some say nay and some say yes?
                        Answer: It first starts with having the right mindset.
                        Your mind is the engine of your actions. If your thought is religating your expectations of life, that is the point one loses.
                        So in the midst of all, right and positive mindset needs to be handy. That is what helps you to navigate different stages of challenges.
                        </p>
                    <p>Well said, Sir. That is the drive.
                        However, as much as things might appear motivational whereas they are not intended to be so, there are times, one needs to be flexible in times of crises.
                        This and many more we will treat as we move further.
                        However, I don’t have the perfect view of the context this is coming from.
                        </p>
                    <p>Good night, everyone. <br>Thank you for the participation.</p>
