                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Going through my Instagram feeds, I stumbled on Fela Durotoye’s video post where the words: “use your peace time to prepare for war” were mentioned. This really sealed up my thought on the words, and gave life to what I will be exposing in subsequent paragraphs of this piece.</p>
                    <p>Being on earth means you have won a lot of fights that you are not even aware of. Biologically speaking, in your father’s semen were a lot of spermatozoa which you were part. Why was it you that fertilized that fortunate egg in your mother’s ovary?</p>
                    <p>There was a competition! But you won! Then, you appeared on earth.</p>
                    <p>Frankly speaking, everyone on earth actually have received a sense of success for making it to earth. Meanwhile, success is continual. It can be defined by time; hence, it is a continuous adventure!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>In the words of my spiritual father and mentor, Pastor Akintola Samuel, “Success is not about what is achieved but the time it is achieved.”.</p>

        <div class="container">

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>There are some things that make you successful in your youth but when you have those things in your 60s, they become acquisition of some sort but not actually the real definition of being successful. With this, proactive measures cannot be relegated in the becoming of anyone who wants to win; since results are painted by preparation. To note, you win before a war (fight), you don’t win during war.</p>
                    <p>My Pastor will always say wisdom is the ability to face the future with answers. Most times, you could decipher what your results would be after an exam. Not because you have soothsayers’ skills, but because your prior preparation revealed that.</p>
                    <p>Now let’s unravel the peace time, which is the time to work on yourself without external pressures. It is a time you dig and taking roots deep down. Peace time is when you have the sanity to think on your own real state. That doesn’t mean your peace time solves all the problems you will face during the wars ahead, but it reduces the chances of defeat.</p>
                    <p>Do you know what?
                        War time can be your peace time if you have the foresight of future challenges and solve them accordingly. You don’t need to fight all fights if you had coordinate measures to help you overcome in times to come. Peace time is where you count the costs; where you weight the options; and fine-tune those rough ideas.
                        </p>
                    <p>Your peace time is important!</p>

                    <p>Wars are won not by the superiority of weaponries or ammunitions but by the superiority of strategies!</p>
                    <p>All you need is not only money! All you need is not only connection! All you need is first the right thought and right motion.</p>
                    <p>So, you are thinking, my present reality is war itself. I’m even in the middle of war.</p>
                    <p>That’s fine, but do you know that your present state is another person’s ideal state? What I mean is that if another person stands in your shoes now, they see themselves as victors!</p>
                    <p>It is a mental distortion to think your peace time must be overly peaceful. If you don’t take proactive measures at the immediate, you will meet greater wars that will truly show you your present time is truly a peace time.</p>
                    <p>Prepare for war! Everybody is a fighter. You started even when you never knew what fighting was. You fought in that dark room of ovary amidst the pool of blood. While you fight, you are taking a form, and embracing growth.</p>
                    <p>Growth challenges the norm and it comes with discomfort! That is war! A change in status doesn’t come always with a pat on your back nor with a smile on your face. You are engraced for this race dear and you must go forward.</p>

                    <p>Giants are ahead. You need to win the giants first in your mind before the fight. Weaknesses are there but you need to see beyond your weaknesses and fight. Many things will put a hold on your potentials but you need to silence the hurdles and fight.</p>
                    <p>Your peace time is your preparation time, your war time is your result time. Earn it!</p>
                    <p>What if I am defeated?</p>
                    <p>Fine! I mean it’s fine! Who told you the best sports clubs win all their matches? No. They don’t! Some times, they even face bigger shame by losing to small clubs!</p>
                    <p>What’s keeps the great great is the ability to stand up after each fall and emerge into something far bigger than their wierldest expectations.</p>
                    <p>Yes, what’s keeping them on top is their resilience and conviction not to fail.</p>
                    <p>Let me tell you about the flower. Flowers are beautiful right? Yes, we all know. Do you know flowers are always defeated and lose their beauty in order for the fruits to emerge!</p>
                    <p>Do you know the fruit gives up for multiples of seeds to be produced?</p>
                    <p>Listen, everything in life evolves. For every decline, there is a rise after. Yes, you inclusive. And it doesn’t come at no cost. It comes with the price. Failure is not an event, it is a result! You become a failure when you allow it to become a constant reoccurrence.</p>
                    <p>Today, please, declare a great war against your war time with your peace time. Utilise the preparation time. Probably, you won’t deccipate much energy as the exercise will be a sweet adventure.</p>
                    <p>Love from TMLC.</p>
